2014-portfolio-master
=====================

Let's not pretend that I'm actually going to blog. Ain't nobody got time for that shit.

This is the source repository for my interim portfolio site; the actual site is powered from a different repository,
found here: https://github.com/samanthamichele7/samanthamichele7.github.io/

Why two repositories, you ask? Because I'm trying some crazy animations that may or may not look like crap on 
different screen sizes and need a legitimate staging environment.

Some of the stuff I used to build this site:
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
- [Skrollr](http://prinzhorn.github.io/skrollr/)
